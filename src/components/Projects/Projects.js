              description="While novel computer vision architectures are gaining traction, the impact of model architectures is often related to changes or exploring in training methods. Identity mapping-based architectures ResNets and DenseNets have promised path-breaking results in the image classification task and are go-to methods for even now if the data given is fairly limited. Considering the ease of training with limited resources this work revisits the ResNets and improves the ResNet50 by using mixup data-augmentation as regularization and tuning the hyper-parameters."

designed pipeline using Yolo algorithm to detect the boxed objects first and later on got class imbalance quotientâ€™s
from the training data-sets and used those on the box by box segmented results to reduce false-positive intersections

              Deep CNN helped to count near the part of the image where the density of the crowd is very high and shallow CNN
helped in detecting the persons who are completely visible (where the complete body was visible).
This method could detect up to 80% accuracy where the actual count in the image is approximately as high as 4000"
